        <p>A pressure washing service is a professional cleaning method that uses high-pressure water spray to remove dirt, grime, mold, algae, mildew, and other contaminants from exterior surfaces. It is commonly used on driveways, sidewalks, decks, fences, siding, roofs, and <a href="https://web.facebook.com/kypressurewashing"><b>commercial buildings</b></a>. By using specialized equipment, a pressure washing service can deeply clean hard-to-reach or heavily soiled areas far more effectively than standard cleaning methods.

         How often should I schedule a pressure washing service?

          </h2>
          <div id="collapseOne" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion">
            <div class="accordion-body">Most Louisville homeowners benefit from an annual or bi‑annual washing. High-traffic areas or regions with lots of pollen/mildew might need quarterly attention for best results.

              What’s the difference between power washing vs. soft washing?

            </button>
          </h2>
          <div id="collapseTwo" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion">
            <div class="accordion-body">Power washing uses high-pressure water to blast off tough stains—ideal for concrete or brick. Soft washing applies low-pressure, eco-friendly solutions, and is safer for roofs, siding, and delicate materials.

        Can a pressure washer damage my property?

          </h2>
          <div id="collapseThree" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion">
            <div class="accordion-body">Yes—if misused. Oversized pressure, improper nozzles, or harsh chemicals can harm surfaces like wood, paint, or shingles. That’s why hiring professionals like Hydro Solutions ensures your property is cleaned safely, efficiently, and without risk.
